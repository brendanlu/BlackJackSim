A rough log of things we will need to look after on the Python wrapping side
    - reading in strat templates appropriately, and providing support for people to customize this highly
    - linking agents in, with their IDs - C++ IDs are sequential (basically the stack array index), 
        but Pythons need not be, we could use a dict or something for housekeeping 
        this stuff is not performance critical
    - other simulation engine setter methods
    - logging simulation information (in the tight event loop) into a stream or something
        we will probably need to wrap the C++ stream in Cython
        and decode logging information
