Some rough notes for personal reference as I work on this, and for doing similar things in future.

"""
So far, the only stochastic mechanism in this whole system lies in the Shoe class.
Each instance of this class instantiates, and randomly seeds its own rng from the C++ stdlibrary. 
Then it uses this 'source of randomness' to shuffle its cards. 

But, we need to be sure that our implementation of shuffling does not produce any bias, 
especially over shuffles which may reach up to 8*52=416 total elements.

The Fisher Yates algorithm seems to be a simple and efficient implementation of shuffling, 
but I am not sure if we have some restrictions given the nature of pseudo-rngs.

Later, we can add count-deviated strategies as multiple strategy files. 
    Perhaps agents can have an unordered map of count cutoffs (or something)
    to the strategy pointer.
